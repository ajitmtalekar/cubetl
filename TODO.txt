[HEAD]

    * File poll mode, file follow mode, stream mode (StandardInputReader)...
    * Implement batch inserts, test performance (BufferedInsertsSQLTable).
    * Threading considerations
    * Django app, and automatic integration with models
    * Unit tests / integration tests
    * Packaging: pip * deb (review build scripts, etc)
    * Twitter API library (yaml)
    * Finer logging configuration, categories... via config too.
    * Good exception management and exception hierarchy

    * GeoIP / Address / DNS / UserAgent shall be lookups (GeoIP installation fails on Windows via pip: move to cubetl-geo)?
    * Geocoding

    * CSVReader shall work with a stream, and optionally accept a whole file as variable (review)

    * Implement mail log parsing (separate project: cubelogs)
    * Implement apache log parsing (separate project: cubelogs)
    * Implement VFS module (remove fs module if performance is ok).

    * Cubes10 export ordering of joins (masters to bottom) ? check
    * Cubes10 export of FactDimension: not include as dimension, mappings for embedded attributes without table prefix ? check
    * Cubes10 export of FactDimension: do not export as dimension ? check
    * Cubes10 export of measures and aggregations ? check

    * WAMP client application (view flow, capture/show next message, inject/test messages on arbitrary nodes, view states)
      Shortcut: serve application
    * WAMP connector
    * Orchestrate message passing externally.

    * Finish and add example for template support (mako)

    * Publish?
    * Internal and External documentation (possibly best after config and examples exist)
    * Include system is order-dependant, because of !refs (check YAML references / lazy refs/proxies / ... ?).
    * Load includes once.
    * Correct entry point, setup.py, path considerations.
    * Include library through library path.
